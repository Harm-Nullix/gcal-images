# gcal-images

Thanks to [Carlos Martins](http://www.internetbestsecrets.com/2019/09/google-calendar-event-images.html) at Internet's Best Secrets, a number of keywords were found that will link images to Google Calendar.
I wanted to make use of these calendar header icons in KLWP so created this repository to track any images I find.

## How to use them
If you're wanting to access the URL directly, the name of the image from `images` folder should be appended to the end of this URL:
`https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_{here}.jpg`

For example, if I'm wanting to access the image for `theateropera.jpg` I would use the below URL:
`https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_theateropera.jpg`

I checked ~130,000 words against the URL and downloaded any which worked so the `images` folder is a bit of a dictionary for what exists.
There may be more that weren't listed on the Internet's Best Secrets site either in the OP or in the comments, that are conjugations of words (e.g. `americanfootball`), but I've found and added as many as I've been able to.

## Calendar Keywords
Thanks again to Carlos Martins, we have keywords for a number of the images which, when used in Google Calendar titles, will link the relevant images.
Again, a number are not included as this is before more were discovered, but it's a good start.
